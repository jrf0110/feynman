# Richard Feynman was an awesome dude.

## Feynman is an awesome message displaying application

I wanted to be able to display messages on one of my monitors and not have some cheesy-looking post-it widget. Just random stuff like, "Don't stop believin'" or "Remember: treat a girl like dirt and she will stick to you like mud." I didn't really have an outlet for that.
